- Merge multiple (conflicting) LED states (needs system ID)
  - merge strategy
  - alternate
  - mix
  - first wins
- Make LED resolver something that can be changed dynamically at any time
- Test going from attract mode to in game. Check if push_runtime works with +send+'static
- Player points plugin
- Maybe color should be it's own top-level feature (or separate crate?)
